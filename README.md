TEI refactoring of yiddish drama
#### preliminary
the text was transcribed from image sources of hebrew type in transkribus.   
the correction process was semi automatised i.e. patterns of the niqqud vocalisation (which were generally not very good OCR'ed) were corrected with an algorithm. (cf. <https://github.com/esteeschwarz/ETCRA5_dd23/dybbuk>)
#### goal
the drama is to be published at dracor in TEI format on base of the transcribed text.
#### method
- base markup for conversion via jupyter notebook at: <https://github.com/dracor-org/ezdrama>
