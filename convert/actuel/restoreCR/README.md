while we fastway decided to delete all linebreaks in the transcript to apply to the ezdrama markup conventions as speaker \<p> only should contain 1 utterance, it seemed a good idea for editorial reasons to preserving the original layout of the print with all new transcript corrections which have been done to the compact version.
